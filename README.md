# Dog Food Recomendation -- Amazon Hackathon 2022/10

Amazon collaborated with Columbia University together holding a Hackathon with a theme of recommending products (Dog food). The projects main aim is to design a 'WOOF' function that can gives each customer a score representing whether Amazon should recommend the product or not (WOOF = 1 meaning strongly recommend where WOOF = 0 meaning suggest not recommend). This project builds a model using Neural Network to predict the probabilities for each dog food brand that a new Amazon user may potentially purchase. In other words, this project is a multiclass classification problem.
