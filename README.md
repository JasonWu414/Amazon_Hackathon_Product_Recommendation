# Amazon_Hackathon_Proteam

Amazon collaborated with Columbia University together holding a Hackathon with a theme of recommending products (Dog food). This project builds a model using Neural Network and predict the probabilities for each dog food brand that a new Amazon user may potentially purchase. In other words, this project is a multiclass classification problem. There is also an Slide posted that used for the final presentation.
